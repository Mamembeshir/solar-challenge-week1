# Solar Challenge Week 1

This project analyzes solar potential across three West African countries—Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo—using minute-level solar radiation data. The project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebooks for each country and a Streamlit dashboard to visualize the results interactively. The work was completed as part of a challenge on Wednesday, May 21, 2025, concluding at 09:22 PM EAT.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:
- Perform EDA on solar radiation datasets for Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo.
- Clean and preprocess the data, saving the results as `benin_clean.csv`, `sierra_leone_clean.csv`, and `togo_clean.csv`.
- Compare solar potential across the three countries using statistical tests and visualizations.
- Develop a Streamlit dashboard to interactively visualize the results.

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- **Git**: For cloning the repository.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running the EDA notebooks.
- **Virtual Environment**: Recommended to manage dependencies.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd solar-challenge-week1
   git checkout dashboard-dev

Set Up a Virtual Environment:
bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install Dependencies:
bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

This installs pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, jupyter, streamlit, and plotly.

EDA Notebooks
The EDA notebooks in the notebooks/ directory analyze the solar radiation data for each country and save cleaned datasets to the data/ folder.
Usage Instructions
Navigate to the notebooks/ Directory:
bash

cd notebooks

Start Jupyter Notebook:
bash

jupyter notebook

Run the Notebooks:
Open benin_eda.ipynb, sierra_leone_eda.ipynb, and togo_eda.ipynb to perform EDA for each country.

Run all cells in each notebook to clean the data and save the results as ../data/<country>_clean.csv.

Open compare_countries.ipynb to compare solar potential across the three countries using statistical tests (e.g., ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis) and visualizations (e.g., boxplots, summary tables).

Outputs
Cleaned Datasets: benin_clean.csv, sierra_leone_clean.csv, togo_clean.csv in the data/ folder.

Comparison Results: Statistical test results and visualizations in compare_countries.ipynb.

Streamlit Dashboard (Basic Version)
A Streamlit dashboard has been developed to visualize solar potential interactively. The dashboard includes:
A multiselect widget to choose countries for comparison.

A boxplot of GHI distributions for the selected countries.

A table ranking the selected countries by average GHI.

Development Process
The dashboard was developed on Wednesday, May 21, 2025, from 08:00 PM to 09:22 PM EAT. The process involved:
Branch Creation: Created the dashboard-dev branch:
bash

git checkout -b dashboard-dev

Virtual Environment Setup: Set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Dependency Installation: Installed required packages and generated a requirements.txt file:
bash

pip install streamlit plotly pandas
pip freeze > requirements.txt

App Structure: Created the app/ directory with:
app/__init__.py: An empty file to make app/ a Python package.

app/main.py: The main Streamlit application script.

Initial Implementation: Added the dashboard functionality in app/main.py (committed with message feat: basic Streamlit UI).

Path Fix: Adjusted the file path in load_data() from ../../data/ to ../data/ (committed with message fix: correct filename and path for Sierra Leone data).

Debugging Sierra Leone Data: Identified and addressed an issue where Sierra Leone data appeared empty due to invalid GHI data in sierra_leone_clean.csv. Recommended re-running the Sierra Leone EDA notebook to regenerate the file (committed with message chore: remove debugging statements from Streamlit app).

Git Hygiene: Ensured data/ remains ignored in .gitignore:

data/

Usage Instructions
To run the dashboard locally:
Ensure the Setup Instructions Above Are Complete:
The virtual environment should be active, and dependencies installed.

Ensure Cleaned Datasets Are Available:
The app requires benin_clean.csv, sierra_leone_clean.csv, and togo_clean.csv in the data/ folder.

Generate these files by running the EDA notebooks (see above).

Navigate to the app/ Directory:
bash

cd app

Run the App:
bash

streamlit run main.py

View the Dashboard:
Open http://localhost:8501 in your browser.

Use the multiselect widget to choose countries and explore the GHI boxplot and top regions table.

Troubleshooting
Sierra Leone Data Appears Empty:
Fix: Re-run the Sierra Leone EDA notebook (notebooks/sierra_leone_eda.ipynb) to regenerate sierra_leone_clean.csv with valid GHI data.
bash

cd notebooks
jupyter notebook

FileNotFoundError: Ensure the cleaned CSV files are in the data/ folder:
bash

ls data/

ModuleNotFoundError: Verify dependencies are installed:
bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Note: The app reads data from local CSVs. For deployment to Streamlit Community Cloud, host the CSVs on a public URL and update load_data() to fetch from those URLs.

```bash
cd ../  # From solar-challenge-week1/app/ to solar-challenge-week1/

2.2 Replace the README.md Content
Open README.md in a text editor and replace its content with the above section.
Using nano:
bash

git push origin dashboard-dev

3.2 Update the Pull Request (PR)
If you have an open PR for the dashboard-dev branch, this commit will be added to it.

If not, create a PR on GitHub with a description like:

This PR adds a basic Streamlit dashboard with:
- A multiselect widget to choose countries.
- A boxplot of GHI for the selected countries.
- A table ranking regions by average GHI.
- Fixed filename and path for Sierra Leone data.
- Added a complete README with project overview, EDA instructions, and Streamlit dashboard details.
The app is located in `app/main.py` and reads data from local CSVs in `data/`.

Step 4: Final Notes
Current Time: It’s 09:22 PM EAT on Wednesday, May 21, 2025, as confirmed by the system.

README Content: The README.md now includes:
A project overview and directory structure.

Setup instructions for the entire project.

Usage instructions for the EDA notebooks and Streamlit dashboard.

A detailed development process for the dashboard.

Troubleshooting tips and notes on deployment.

Next Steps: Test the app to confirm Sierra Leone data displays correctly after regenerating sierra_leone_clean.csv. If you’re ready to deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud, let me know, and I can help adjust the app for deployment.
